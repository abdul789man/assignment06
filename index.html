Dear Peter<br>
      <br>
      <b>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</b>
      <br><br>
I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on Trade Me on 14 February 2013.<br>
      <br>
I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the position, including:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>
time management and strong organisational skills
          </li><li>
 high-level customer service and friendly relationship management
          </li><li>
cash handling and sales ability
            </li><li>
 motivation and dedication</li></ul>
            <br><br>
As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail career.
              <br><br>
              I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview.
              <br><br>
              Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
              <br><br>
Yours sincerely
              <br><br>
Lizzie Long</p>
